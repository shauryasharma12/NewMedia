    Originally the story is setup in a world where super powers are real and heroes are a real thing and have been recognized by the government. It started with Izuku Midoriya or say Deku who does not have any ability but still want to become a superhero. The wheel of luck spun which connected the strings of fate of Deku with ALL MIGHT, the current No.1 hero of world.

    Initially you could compare the story with Naruto in which the protagonist aims to achieve something and works hard for it. But later as the story progresses the Mangaka widens the world giving importance to other characters.

    In the recent Arcs of the story which are sort of solely focused on villains have portrayed the back story of villains and have bend the story to the point where the readers have actually started to side with the view point of villlains.

    The most recent case is of Dabi an important character from the villain side who is revealed to be the eldest son of Endeavour, current top Hero of the world. The recent chapters shows how Endeavour abused his son with brutal training which caused an accident in which everyone thought dabi is dead and at the only regret Endeavour had was losing a possible chance that his blood surpass ALL MIGHT.

  <p class="para1">
    Dabi is one of the many characters whose point of view forces the readers to fell in the love and make the hero side more unjust. Who knows what will happen in this series as the way the mangaka is drawing its kind of impossible to predict what will happen next.
